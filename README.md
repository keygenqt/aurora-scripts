# Aurora CLI

![preview.png](data/preview.png)

An application that combines different scripts that help an Aurora OS programmer in his daily work. You can use separate scripts - each of them is an atomic unit. Or install a CLI application (available in snap) and use all the scripts if necessary with a convenient interface.
